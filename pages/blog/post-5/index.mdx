## Hack the future
Hack the future is one of the biggest hackatons in flanders and i had the privilige of taking part in it toghether with Fabian Cogghe.
we chose the mobile challenge since it listed xamarin and we both really like .net so xamaring was a nice challenge, we both had not done that yet.

## start of the day
in the beginning of the day we were briefed about what we had to do, we needed to visualise data you had a player wich needed to reach a point but there were areas you could not pass and "beasts" that could kill you.
we had the advantage of being corona buddies so we could sit next to each other wich was a big plus.

## the hacktaton itself
we started coding in xamarin and faced a lot of challenges but toghether we got through them and we learned a lot that day and also that we had a good synergie toghether. 

## the result 
we failed to snatch the first place but we did end up in the top 3 for wich we are both very proud.
