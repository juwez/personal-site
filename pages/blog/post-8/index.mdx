## the windows lover
i started out as most people with a regular windows computer.
in my second year i heard the claim from everyone that linux was a lot better so i wanted to try it out i first installed ubuntu and was like ok its cool but i still prefer windows, then i tried fedora and i had the same feeling : sure this could replace windows but i still have windows so why should i.
## the arch experience
once i saw my friend yenti his desktop i was in awe his computer was unique so i asked him about it and i heard "this is arch".
i had seen the memes online but wen for it i installed arch and just kept using it because unlike windows i could style it however i wanted , you dont like something ? no problem just change it.
i also lost my gui love.
ever since i got into vim i dreaded grabbing the mouse so i was automatticly more inclined to type instead of clicking windows so i started learning more and more about the terminal and even forced myself to do certain things on the terminal and can now do things in 2 lines that would take 10 mouseclicks.
and so my adventure continues now im getting into tiling window managers.

## the gnu/unix eco system
once you get to know the community behind arch and othe open source project it forms a kinship unlike the memes depict you can learn a lot from them and they are very friendly 
## conclusion
this post is very short because i have not even had a year to use arch as a daily driver but its an adventure i am enjoying and learning more and more everyday.
