## The windows lover
I started out as most people with a regular windows computer.
In my second year I heard the claim from everyone that linux was a lot better so I wanted to try it out I first installed ubuntu and was like ok its cool but i still prefer windows, then i tried fedora and I had the same feeling : sure this could replace windows but I still have windows so why should I.
## the arch experience
Once I saw my friend yenti his desktop I was in awe his computer was unique so i asked him about it and I heard "this is arch".
I had seen the memes online but went for it I installed arch and just kept using it because unlike windows I could style it however i wanted , you dont like something ? no problem just change it.
I also lost my gui love.
Ever since I got into vim I dreaded grabbing the mouse so I was automatticly more inclined to type instead of clicking windows so i started learning more and more about the terminal and even forced myself to do certain things on the terminal and can now do things in 2 lines that would take 10 mouseclicks.
So my adventure continues now im getting into tiling window managers.

## The gnu/unix eco system
Once you get to know the community behind arch and othe open source project it forms a kinship unlike the memes depict you can learn a lot from them and they are very friendly.
## Conclusion
This post is very short because I have not even had a year to use arch as a daily driver but its an adventure I am enjoying and learning more and more everyday.
