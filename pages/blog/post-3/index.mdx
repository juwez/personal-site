## Why did i look for a job while still studying
i was "unlucky" enough to only have a few courses in the second half of the year so i thought that working would teach me the most.
so i started looking for a job and i want to share all the secrets i learned along my way.
## Linkedin is powefull
Linkedin is a very powerfull platform if you get your profile in order. there is a huge shortage of IT specialists so once you sell yourselfe on LinkedIn your emails and or chat will be flooding.
## your soft skills are very important
in my experience the technical skills only come in to play once you reach the latter stages of the interview in the beginning they will focus on who you are and if you are a good fit for them most companies value a slight worse it'er with great soft skils over a god who no one likes.
the firm where i eventually signed even had me sit down with the tech leads there and while you might think that conversation will mostly be about your tech skills that is not the truth. it was a talk about what my hobbies were and seeing if we get along.
So do not disregard your soft skills
## Be ready for questions you wont expect
### technical questions
Just because you are interviewing for a javascript position does not mean they wont suddenly ask you a question about the fundamentals of computers.
i interviewed with 6 different companies.
and during those interviews i got questions such as: "when i press the power button on my computer do you know what happens?" and "you type in your address bar "company name.be" explain everything that happens" so even though i was applying for a .net developer position i still had the question about HTTP protocols routers etc,
### Unexpected personal questions
at one firm i got the question so what games do you like to play my answer was hades at the time time this was a quite popular roguelike rpg.
so this means you play but when you die you reset everything.
and here my motivations for this game were asked to evaluate my personality without the old "name x negative things about yourself" this was the most original question.
but i also had other questions like this at other firms asking about my hobbies and what the motivations were behind this.
so the conclusion is: everything you tell someone be ready that they will ask you the why and the how.
## compensation
this was a question i was badly prepared for.
i was going to leave the ball in their camp and let them come up with an offer.
this does not work, they ask you what do you expect as compensation, so make sure you have a number in mind and dont forget advantages such as for example a laptop.

i still ask myself the question if i asked enough at the firm i signed at becuase the number i said the boss just said , ok fine.
so this makes me question if i could have gotten more out of it.
## being tired
do not underestimate this when you have 3 interviews in one day you will be tired this takes a lot of mental energy.
## your portfolio is more important than your degree
your degree gets you in the door but your portfolio lands you the job
