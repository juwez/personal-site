## TTT at codefever
usually we have a yearly teach the teacher day where we get thought about the best ways to teach

## Corona situation
due to corona this was changed to a webinair.
wich was very helpfull.
we cant forget we are teaching complex matter to small children and therefore this webinair was helpfull.
i cant share the exact contents of this webinair as it is intelectual property of Codefever.
but we spent 2 hours learning how to handle children , reassuring them , what to do when they lose faith in themselves etc
