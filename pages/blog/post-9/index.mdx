## TTT at codefever
Usually we have a yearly teach the teacher day where we get taught about the best ways to teach.

## Corona situation
Due to corona this was changed to a webinair.
Wich was very helpfull.
We can't forget we are teaching complex matter to small children and therefore this webinair was helpfull.
I cant share the exact contents of this webinair as it is intelectual property of Codefever.
We spent 2 hours learning how to handle children , reassuring them , what to do when they lose faith in themselves, etc.
