## Lisp
Lisp has two popular offsprings scheme and common Lisp, whilst scheme is more popular this tutorial will be about common Lisp

## Things you should have 
A linux enviroment.
## Who is this for ?
People who are interested in this language and want to get a working enviroment up and running.
## What will you know at the end ?
The "weird" way in wich Lisp work.
At the end of this tutorial you will have a working installation of doom emacs (the editor) and a Lisp environment.
## installing Lisp
So first we will install steelbank common Lisp, this will be your Lisp compiler.
Most modern languages ship with a compiler(the little run button) Lisp does not do this so we have to install that.
Steelbank common Lisp is one of the more popular ones therefore i choose this one.

We will also install rlwrap why is? This so we can use our up and down keys and they dont become those weird characters
and then finally emacs.
To all the vim users please dont leave yet when you read this we will make it vim friendly

So that gives the command sudo pacman -S sbcl rlwrap emacs.
Depending on your distro you will need to change pacman to your package manager.
## Making emacs evil 
Now we want the evil mode in emacs.
Doom emacs has its own github page but to save you a click to install doom emacs you will need this command.

`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d`

Once that is done you will need this command.

`~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install`

During the installation process you can just press yes the entire time this is so you can install the fonts etc.
When these things are done doom emacs is installed
If everything went ok. You should be greeted by the doom homescreen instead of the regular emacs one

## Enabling common lisp in doom emacs
Now before we can start using doom emacs there is one file we need to change. Since doom emacs can be used for almost everything.
For example I also use it for developing in c , other people use it as an agenda , you can really do almost everyhing with this IDE 
But lets stay here for the lisp.
So press 
spc .
This is she shortcut to browse files 
and go to /home/user/.doom.d/init.el .
There will be a line with `;; common-Lisp`
Delete the ;; , the ;; is used to indicate that this is a commment so we want to uncomment that.
As you can see there are also a lot of other cool options so feel free to experiment with those as well as doom emacs is really a great editor.

## Package manager and starting a project
Now we still need a package manager , for example what pypy does for python importing libarares.
For this we need to install quicklisp, but this is not so straightforward as well 
So firstly we need to download it .
For that you need these commands:
`curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp`
`curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp.asc`
and then verify it with
`gpg --verify quicklisp.lisp.asc quicklisp.lisp`

Now to install this we need to enter a lisp shell.
You can do this by
`sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp`
This will open a shell that has quicklisp loaded.
Now you need to type 
`(quicklisp-quickstart:install)`

So now it is installed but while we are here lets create our first project,
meanwhile we can use quicklisp for the first time.
`(ql:quickload :cl-project)`
This loads the cl-project package
Once its done we can do 
`(cl-project:make-project #p"~/quicklisp/local-projects/demo")`
## playing with emacs
Now we have both doom and common lisp set up and you can finally start playing aroudn with Lisp. 
I hope you found this helpfull.
