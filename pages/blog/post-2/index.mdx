##  What is codefever and what do we do
at codefever we learn children all the skills they need to become a programmer.
This however does not start with instantly drowning them in a programming language
### scratch
We build this up in a slow way we start by learning them scratch very visual yet they need all the basics of programming to make these fun games.
wich gives them a huge intrinsic motivation.
### Minecraft
Once they have the coding virus, we have the next level
Minecraft this is even cooler since this is a game they know and they learn that this is not only a game but actually a big playground for code as well they start with learning how to build houses with code and with using redstone to make crazy projects all without playing the game only pure code.
### E-riders
this is the level where they learn how to make websites with javascript ,HTML and css. 
however javascript is a big scary beast when you are 10 so in the beginning we do this with a microbit. a little computer that can do a lot but has to be coded in javascript , this maekes is fun for the kids they want that computer to do things and in the way we teach it it is actually fairly easy.
Once the microbit has been fully programmed we take this knowledge and bring it to the websites in wich they make responsive and functional website.
### Python
in this level the "real" programming starts.
here we start teaching them first the basic of programming that were not covered in previous levels.
that takes about 4 weeks after that we start showing them data science , subclasses, everything you would learn in a first year of Applied informatics and even a bit more.
### Anonymous
this level is our newest level and show the children the basics of linux , once they understand that we start teaching them how to ethically hack.
sadly i can not tell more about this i have not yet had the you of teaching this class.
## how did i begin working here
One day a friend of mine got sick and asked me if i could take over his class , i saw the material and was excepting a class of young adults because it was quite advanced but there i saw these children, i was not yet a teacher at that moment but an assistent.
The boss asked if i liked and i did a lot so i became an assistent for 3 seasons after wich they invited me to become a teacher instead ever since then i have been standing in front of the class making the children laugh and seeing the magic in their eyes when the coding puzzle clicks.
