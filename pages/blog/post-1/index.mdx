## Why Next.js 

The firm i worked at used next.js so i knew it existed but never had the pleasure of working with it.
So when it came to making this blog i wanted to try it out.
in this article i will explain what next.js is excactly, its use cases and where it shines.

## What is Next.js
Next.js is a framework composed of a react front end and express.
it solves the problem of sending huge javascript packages to the users and letting them compile that client side.
especially with react and other frameworks this is the case you are sending a big package of javascript and the user has to compile that to HTML.
Now Next.js solves this problem
now developers can write their code go as crazy as they want no longer having to think about the end user because all the rendering is done on the server.
of course Next.js has a list of other advantages but this is the biggest one in my humble opnionion for the end user.
## Why did i make this blog in next.js ?
Next.js also takes a lot of developer problems away.
mainly the following
SEO , while developer always find this one pretty hard , next.js out of the box comes with SEO.
the other huge benefits is that you can get a site up and running fairly quickly.
if we dont count the content the whole setup was done in less than 2 hours.
this is because next.js has a lot of out of the box support through web pack , asset compilation hot realoading code splitting. anyone with a decent javascript and react knowledge can pick up this framework very easily.
it is also very extensible. for example i prefer mdx pages to write my blogposts in , this is loading a depandancy and here i am writing this in mdx.
## Should i learn Next.js
Next.js is an active member of the react eco system so if you are a react developer. 
I highly encourage learning this. 
It has a low learning curve and it is becoming more and more popular. So Next.js is here to stay in my opinion
## how did i make this blog
I took the Next.js starter template threw out what i did not need because next.js comes with a lot of stuff out of the box.
then i wrote my config file to allow mdx files because i prefer to write in that
then i made function that fetches all the posts this way i did not need a headless cms or a database and could all store it in my files since this is a static site.
the i started seperating my page into react components.
Once that was all done i only had to create a new mdx file to make a blog post
