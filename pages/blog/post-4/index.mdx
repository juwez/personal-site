## school prepares you for work , but the learning has only begun
the first days of working are very impressive, you see people doing things you hardly knew were possible.
this however also gave me my first realisation no matter how good you were at school. school prepares you for work. 
however at work the real learning starts. 
in the months i worked there i learned more than in my entire education. This due to the fact when you are surrounded by brilliant minds and show a healthy interest you learn a lot automaticly.
this is ofcourse not to downtalk my education because there i learned a very strong foundation.
## work pressure
At school when you dont meet a deadline , best case scenario you can still make up your marks, worst case scenario you try a second time.
at work this is not the case you have a deadline and that deadline needs to be met. if you dont meet a deadline that is not acceptable.
So while this is not a bad thing it does make you concious that you have to deliver and thus cant slack off.
worst case scenario this means a lot of extra hours. 
## Keeping work and free time seperated
This is a workpoint for myself when my work was over or even in the weekend if there was a bug i would keep thinking about it. whilst at school you allot a certain amount of time to something and if you take your break you take your break.
## code reviews
When working at school projects you can get away with a lot of sub optimal code or even "crappy" code.
this does not work in a big firm there your code gets reviewed for the tiniest mistake , i had pull requests denied because of i forgot a space.
this makes your code quality rise through the roof, because you become very critical of your code.
it is not that you are scared to push bad code because that happens it is that you dont want you pull request to be revieuwed 5 times so you quickly grow an eye for quality.
## performance reviews
We had the habit of reviewing the progress you made a lot. this really offers a good look on your actual skills. 
these performance review made me realise i was not so good of a backend developer as i thought but a way better front end developer than i thought.
## daily standup
i found these very fun especially in corona times, it provides a certain kinship.
It also offers an insight into what other people are doing that you would not normally work with.
For example we had a game developer there so it was always cool to see what he was doing and then doing some of your own research after your hours.
## becoming even more addicted to code
my first week was filled with oof that was a heavy day time for some gaming.
but after a while i noticed that when work was done or even during my breaks i would start reading up on things, learning, and making small projects with all the cool stuff that were mentioned at work. 
put a bunch of programmers toghether and a lot of cool technologies come to the surface
